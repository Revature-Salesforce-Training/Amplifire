# Project 2: City Of Angels Talent & Recruitment Agency

## Dev Model
Let's review/refresh pbd so that we all know the steps

- Follow Best Practices: code headers; comments etc.

## Businees Requirements & User Stories

- Tentative Requirements:
    - portal for big studio clients
    - portal for individual clients
    - login/registration page
    - casting app that is just a clone of sales app; intended for field reps and studios
    - recruitment app that is also clone of sales app; intended for scouts and individual artists
    - IMPORTANT Difference between scouts and fld reps: different contract structure: 2 record types on the contract standard object
            - both fld reps and scouts work on commission and take a percentage off closed deals; freps should be capped at 30% contract value; scouts have no cap
